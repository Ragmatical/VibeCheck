VibeCheck is a Spotify Enhancer for the typical teenager to create niche, mini-playlists from an ultimat playlist.

During these unprecedented times, many of us have turned to music to lift our souls, connect to one another, and focus on our studying. 
Good music, however, does not come easy, and many people struggle with building the ultimate playlist. Our team looked to solve this problem. 
There is only so much music a person can sample before they go crazy from the finding, skipping, and adding that building a great playlist takes. 
Our team wanted to have a simple, streamlined, and one-click solution that can help all Spotify users further expand their musical horizon. 

As such, our project addresses the challenge of finding good, vibe-specific playlists using K-means clustering. 

In order to use the Python Notebook, download it and follow the instructions. EDA and brief result analysis were also included for ease of usage.

From VibeCheck,
Thanks!
